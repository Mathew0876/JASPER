## Getting Started
The first step in development was setting up the development environment. This included downloading and setting up Vagrant for managing virtual machines. At the start of the project Laravel recommended using a pre-configured Vagrant environment called Homestead when developing on Windows Devices. These instructions were followed to set up the virtual machines with virtual box: https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead#introduction. Now Laravel installation guide recommends using Docker Desktop https://laravel.com/docs/8.x#getting-started-on-windows but this has not been tested. This was developed using Laravel 8.
